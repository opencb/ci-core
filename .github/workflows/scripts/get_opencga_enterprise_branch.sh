#
# This script computes the correct opencga-enterprise branch to use for testing a PR in any Xetabase component repo.
# It unifies the logic previously duplicated in java-common-libs, biodata, and opencga.
#
# Inputs:
#   1. project (artifactId from pom.xml)
#   2. base_ref (target branch of the PR)
#   3. head_ref (source branch of the PR)
#
# Output:
#   Prints the resolved opencga-enterprise branch to stdout.
#   Exits with non-zero and error message if it cannot resolve a branch.
